```{r}
library(tidyverse)
source("functions.R")
source("sim-league_functions.R")
```

do I have leagues?

```{r}
leagues
```

how do I get from here to urls?

```{r}
i <- 91
lgrds <- with(leagues[i,], make_fname(country, league, season, part, prefix = ""))
lgrds
the_url <- make_url(lgrds)
the_url
```

```{r}
get_league_table_url(lgrds)
```

maybe what I need is a spreadsheet that has the schedule url and the league table url for each league
which I can presumably make from the leagues df and then edit

```{r}
leagues %>% 
  rowwise() %>% 
  mutate(rds_name = make_fname(country, league, season, part, prefix = "")) %>% 
  mutate(schedule_url = make_url(rds_name)) %>% 
  mutate(table_url = get_league_table_url(rds_name)) %>% 
  select(rds_name:table_url) %>% 
  write_csv("league_urls.csv")
```
